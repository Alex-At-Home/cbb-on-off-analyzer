# Verify TypeScript Before Marking Code Complete

Before treating a change as finished:

1. Run **`npx tsc --noEmit`** and fix any TypeScript errors in the files you modified.
2. Optionally run **Read Lints** on those files and address any reported issues.

Do not leave type errors or syntax errors in "finished" code. If `tsc` reports errors elsewhere in the repo, you only need to fix errors in files you changed.

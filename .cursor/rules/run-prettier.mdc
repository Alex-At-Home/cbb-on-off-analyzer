# Run Prettier When Done

Always run Prettier on **every file you have changed** before finishing your response:

```bash
npx prettier --write <path-to-file>
```

- Run this once per modified file (in `src/` or anywhere in the repo you edited).
- Do not run it on files you did not modify.
- Do this at the end of your work, after all edits are complete.
